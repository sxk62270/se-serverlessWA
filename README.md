Created an S3 bucket: Amazon S3 can be used for hosting static files, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images. You would have created an S3 bucket and uploaded your web application's static files to it.

Designed and implemented your serverless functions: AWS Lambda allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. You would have written your serverless functions using a supported language (e.g., Node.js, Python, Java, etc.). Each function would handle a specific task or endpoint in your application.

Set up an API Gateway: Amazon API Gateway provides a managed service for creating, deploying, and managing RESTful APIs. You would have configured your API Gateway to act as a proxy for your serverless functions, mapping endpoints to the corresponding Lambda functions.

Configured permissions and security: You would have ensured that your Lambda functions, API Gateway, and other AWS resources had the appropriate permissions and security settings. You would have used AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to manage access to resources and applied security best practices.

Set up a database: If your application required a database, you would have considered using AWS DynamoDB, a fully managed NoSQL database service. You would have created the necessary tables and configured access permissions.

Implemented business logic: You would have written the business logic for your application using the serverless functions you created earlier. This would have included processing user input, interacting with the database, and performing any other required operations.

Tested and debugged: You would have tested your application thoroughly to ensure it functioned as expected. You would have used debugging tools and logs provided by AWS Lambda and API Gateway to troubleshoot any issues that arose.

Deployed your application: Once you were satisfied with the functionality and performance of your application, you would have deployed it to AWS. This may have involved creating deployment packages, configuring environment variables, and setting up any necessary infrastructure.

Monitored and scaled: You would have set up monitoring and logging for your application using services like Amazon CloudWatch. You would have monitored resource usage, application performance, and errors. You would have used AWS Auto Scaling to automatically adjust resources based on demand.

Continuously improved: You would have gathered feedback from users, monitored key metrics, and made iterative improvements to your application based on user needs and performance data.
